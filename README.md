# Stock Exchange Simulator

Created a RESTful API using the Spring Framework to simulate a Stock Exchange with a limited pool of users

Utilizes Post request in order to allow users to create listings for the stocks they want to sell on the exchange. Upon creation this stock listing is given a UUID in order to give the listing it's own key to allow users to purchase the specific equity from a person they are looking to buy from.

Utilizes Get request in order to show all Market listings currently, also allows to search by UUID for a particular stock.

Utilizes Delete request in order to allow users to buy the stock that has been listed on the exchange, and consequently remove that stock listing to not allow duplicate buys of a single stock.
